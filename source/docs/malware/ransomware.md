# Ransomware

## Removing

Boot into the mobile phone's ***Safe Mode*** and uninstalling the suspected application:

1. Hold down the physical Power button until you see the Power off prompt on your screen.
2. Long-press the Power off button on your screen until the ***Reboot to safe mode*** dialog box appears.
3. Press ***OK***. The device reboots. The words ***Safe Mode*** appear in the lower left corner of your screen.
4. Go to ***Settings -> Apps***. 
5. Uninstall the ransomware and related application. 

If you can not get rid of the ransomware by booting into ***Safe Mode***, you can try to [reset your Android device to factory settings](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915). A factory reset erases all data on the device, so make sure you make a back-up first.

## Prevention

* Download applications only from the [app stores](../services/app-stores.md) that vet.
* Keep the device updated. Android developers regularly release new patches and updates. Make sure to install the offered updates as soon as you receive notifications on your device. 
* Back up your mobile data on your computer hard drive, one a portable device, or in the cloud. 
* Install [anti-malware applications](scanner.md)
* Disallow non-official app installations:
  1. Go to ***Settings -> Security***. 
  2. Uncheck the ***Unknown sources*** box.
