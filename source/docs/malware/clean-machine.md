# Find the culprit and remove it

## Automagically

Install an [AV scanner](scanner.md), scan, and remove.

## Manually

### Find the culprit

* If the symptoms appeared immediately after installing an app, that app may be the guilty party
* If you get ads in the notification bar, then long tap those and then touch on All Categories to learn which app is displaying the ads
* Go to Settings -> Battery and monitor usage. If you recently charged, Battery usage data is not available. Wait a few hours for the data to become available.
* Go to Settings -> Network & Internet -> Data usage -> Mobile data usage / Wi-Fi data usage

Found? Then remove.

### Remove the malware

* Go to Settings and tap on Apps & Notifications 
* Locate the app 
* Tap on it, and choose Uninstall

If you see the "Uninstall" option is greyed out or not there at all, then it means that the app has gained privileges.

### Remove admin rights

* Go to Settings -> Security & location -> Device admin apps
* Tap on the checkbox and then tap on "Deactivate this device admin app"
* Go back to the Apps & notifications to remove it

### Fail

* If removing admin rights did not work, do a [Factory reset](https://support.google.com/android/answer/6088915?hl=en)
* If a factory reset did not work, it is probably a very persistent malware
