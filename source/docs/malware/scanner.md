# Installing an anti malware app

Google Play Protect is a feature that automatically scans your apps and your device for problems. It will warn you if it finds anything. Play Protect is not enough. 

* It is a Google product and will protect you against any threats, except Google.
* Google Play Protect is unlikely to protect from malicious apps that did not come from its store.

Clean antivirus vendors which are not on the [unwanted apps list](../services/unwanted-apps.md):

* [Emsisoft](https://www.emsisoft.com)
* [Bitdefender Free](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)

## Perhaps

* [LibreAV](https://github.com/projectmatris/antimalwareapp) is an attempt to detect malwares on android devices by utilizing machine learning approach.
* [Hypatia (available on FDroid)](https://f-droid.org/packages/us.spotco.malwarescanner/) is powered by ClamAV style signature databases. AFAIK, the app has NOT been audited, and antivirus apps have the potential to be very bad in terms of privacy. The name "us.spotco.malwarescanner" contains "spot". Will keep an eye out. Do not install yet.
