# Measure Internet Censorship

The [OONI Probe](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openobservatory.ooniprobe) is a free app to measure 
Internet Censorship. 
With this app, you can examine the blocking of websites and instant messaging apps, measure your network's speed and 
performance, and check whether systems that could be responsible for censorship and surveillance are in your network.

OONI Probe is developed by the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), a free software project 
(under The Tor Project) that aims to uncover internet censorship around the world.
