# Shut down location history

Even if you are not using any services that track your location, Android does. It uploads that information to Google 
to store it in your Google account. The data is used to send you personalised maps and recommendations, and targeted 
ads.

On a new phone, don't turn it on. If you are already using it, you can stop Google from tracking you by pausing it. 
This will not keep apps from using location information from your device, but it will stop Google from filling up their 
databases with a detailed profile of your movements.

* Go to Privacy settings -> Google location history. This takes you to the Location History page of your Google account.
* Pause Location History
