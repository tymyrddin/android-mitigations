# Set a password or PIN screen lock and a timeout

Without screen lock, anyone getting their hands on your device will have complete access to everything on it, and 
you can not enable [on-device encryption](../data/encryption.md).

Touch or retinal scans to unlock your phone without needing to enter a password (passcode, PIN) is nice, but in some 
countries biometric authentication methods are not protected the way passwords are. In these countries, law 
enforcement can not compel someone to enter a password to unlock a device without a search warrant, but they can for
access by touch or retinal scan.

In addition, for all people in all countries, raw biometrics data in the form of fingerprints, face or retinal scans or 
voice recognition, for example, is analog data until a biometric system converts it to digital data that a computer can 
then process. This data must be stored somewhere. The convenience of biometric authentication is only worthwhile as 
long as the data being stored remains secure and untapped. For single-user devices, like an Android, this data can be 
stored on the local device. And if data is stored somewhere, it could potentially get stolen. If the worst happens and 
your PIN or password get stolen, you can easily change them. What are you going to do if your fingerprint or Iris scan 
get stolen?

Depending on your Android:

* Settings -> Privacy -> Lock Screen -> Screen Lock Type -> Select one of the screen lock types (OR)
* Settings -> Security -> Screen lock (OR)
* Settings -> Lock screen

And somewhere else in your settings (maybe Display), set a screen timeout.
