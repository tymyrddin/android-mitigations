# Keep notifications off the lock screen

Android displays app notifications on the lock screen. Anyone who happens to be looking (shoulder surfing) can also 
see those notifications, even though your device is locked.

* Go to Settings -> Lock screen.
* Scroll down the Lock screen to Notifications and set the slider to Off.
* There are a lot of options. Just use the slider at the top of the screen to turn it all Off.

Check that lock screen notifications are still turned off any time you make changes to the lock screen.
