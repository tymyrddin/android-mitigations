# Application stores

Apps that do not come from the Google Play store or your device manufacturerâ€™s app store are almost always a bad idea. 
Google and the device manufacturers try to keep their stores clean. They do what they can, no doubt. The Google App 
Store is riddled with [unwanted apps](unwanted-apps.md). 

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is an alternative to the Google Play store that is a trusted source for Android apps, 
many of which do not send any data to Google or Facebook. Apparently, it is the most scrutinized alternative Play store.

Stay aware, awake and alert and [research each app thorougly before installing](research.md).
