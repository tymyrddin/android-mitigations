# Application stores

[I do not like Google and its collection of all our data](../privacy/README.md), but apps that do not come from the Google Play Store or my device manufacturerâ€™s app store are almost always a bad idea. 

Google and the device manufacturers try to keep their stores clean. They do what they can, and the vetting process is improved continuously, but Google Play (and other app stores) can feature [unwanted apps](unwanted-apps.md) though. 

***[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) is an alternative to the Google Play that is a trusted source for Android apps, 
many of which do not send any data to Google or Facebook. Apparently, it is the most scrutinised alternative Play stores.***

Stay aware, awake and alert and [research each app thorougly before installing](research.md).
