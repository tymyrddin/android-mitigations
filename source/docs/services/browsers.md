# Secure browsers that protect your privacy

* [Brave](https://brave.com/) is fast, secure, and privacy-focused by default. It has a built-in ad blocker and browser fingerprinting 
protection, while also giving you access to numerous add-ons and extensions.
* [Ungoogled Chromium browser](https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium) is an open source project to provide a Chromium browser, without the Google privacy issues.
* [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/) is a Chromium-based browser for Android only (no desktop support). It comes with some great features by default, including ad blocking and various privacy enhancements.
* [Tor browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser) enables you to use Tor without needing to install the [Tor proxy](tor-proxy.md).

If the browser you choose is not secure and privacy-friendly, lock down the browser and the software it can invoke.
