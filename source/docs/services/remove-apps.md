# Remove unwanted apps

Every app that exists on your device is a potential privacy and security problem. Google automatically grants every 
app permission to use the Internet, including [unwanted apps](unwanted-apps.md). This means that every single app on 
your device can:

* Send any data it can get its hands on to points unknown somewhere on the Internet
* Receive all kinds of things from the Internet that could affect your device

## Removing third party apps

* Go to Settings -> Apps. You should see a list of the apps on your device.
* Tap an app you donâ€™t absolutely need to have on your device.
* At the bottom, tap Uninstall. OK to uninstall the app.
* Repeat for each app you can do without.
